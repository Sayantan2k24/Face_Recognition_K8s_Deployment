# Face_Recognition_K8s_Deployment

Hey guys!!

We are going to use face recognition app and launch a deployment in my local kubernetes cluster !!

Step 1 - Create Dataset
--------------------------------------------------------

We will capture some images so that we can use those as data

We are capturing and storing the data in a particular directory!

That is

E:\ML_Projects\DataSet\ 


Step 2 - Train the Model
--------------------------------------------------------

Using the data set we will train our model


Step 3 - Face recongnition and launching k8s Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------
we are using face recognition and launch the deployment once the face is recognized



For getting the live status of the deployment, We have created a simple python script

"live_status_k8s_deploy.py"
